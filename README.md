Machine Learning and Data Mining: Regression [Linear (Selection and Shrinkage, Dimension Reduction, Beyond Linearity) &amp; Non-Linear Regressions (Logistics, K-NN, Trees)], Cross Validation (LOOCV, K-Folds, Bias vs. Variance), Classification (LDA, QDA, K-NN, Logistic, Tree, SVM), Clustering (PCA, K-Means, Hierarchical)  This course will provide an introduction to main topics in data mining / statistical learning, including: statistical foundations, data visualization, classification, regression, clustering. Emphasis will be on statistical learning methodology and the models, intuition, and assumptions behind it, as well as applications to real-world problems.  You may find my final project in the stats 415 project folder.  
Project Summary 
 Implemented all the classifier learned throughout the semester to predict obesity rates in America as classified through the BMI with the best classifier as 7-fold KNN and prediction accuracy of 81.54%  
 Analyzed model selection methods to provide the most optimal model and finding the best predictors; concluded that BMI can be non-parametrically predicted based off income, eating habits, exercise habits and shopping habits
